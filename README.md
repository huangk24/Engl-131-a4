> Everyone has many people that are very important to them in the process of growing up, and many of them have acted as our discourse sponsors in some way and help us shape our personality to become who we are right now.

For me, my grandmother might probably be the person who has the most influence on me beside my parents. When I was little, my parents were very busy at work and they always came home very late at night, and I was mainly taking care by my grandmother because I was the youngest one among eight of her grandchildren. I was weak and thin compared to other kids in my age because I was born one month before the expected date of confinement, so she always tried her best to make healthy and nutritious foods for me.

I remember I always asked my grandmother: _“Why does everything taste so light and without too much salt and oil in it? Why do we always eat fish? Why do we always drink all these different types of soup?”_


My grandma would always answer that: _“Eating too much salt and oil is not good for your body; Fishes are good for your brain, and you will be smarter; All the different soup I made are good for your body and they were meant to strengthen your body.”_

Under the influence of my grandmother’s eating habit, I always pay attention of what I should eat more and try to control what I should eat less.

## Soup recipe I learned from my grandmother

In **GuangZhou**, the city where I come from, families have the habit of drinking soup everyday before and after meal, and different soup have different function and benefit to our body.

In my family, my grandmother always looking for different soup for us because we drink soup everyday. She knows what to make in a hot summer, what to make in a cold winter, and what to make when someone in my family get sick. Thus, I really like drinking soup, and I try to make it on my own now since I am far away from home. I asked my grandmother the recipe for some of my favorite soup, and here are some direction:

> Pork bone with red radish and corn soup
- First boil water and blanch the pork bones for 5 - 10 minutes, and remove remain blood and impurities from the bones, then take them out.
- Get a new pan of water, put the bones in while water is cold, add couple slices of ginger, and use high heat to cook for 30 - 40 minutes, then low heat for another 20 - 30 minutes.
- Add red radishes and corn into the soup, and cook them for 30 - 40 minutes, or until the radishes become soft.
- Add salt to the soup as preference in the last 5 - 10 minutes.

The soup I made at first does not taste anything like the one my grandmother made, so I asked her what should I do. She gave me suggestions, and now I am pretty happy about my soup because it is healthy and delicious.

My grandmother not only has huge influence on my eating habit, but she also teaches me many other things. Although Mandarin is the official language in China and what other people from different countries refer as Chinese language, Cantonese is the dominant language in my hometown and has the second most speaker in China. My grandmother only speaks Cantonese, so I have to speak Cantonese to her, which “force” me to speak more and my Cantonese improved a lot because of that. She also taught me to become a better person overall, such as be polite and nice to other people, learn to frugal, and try to become independent.

My grandmother always says to me: **“I am happy when you are happy.”**, which means nothing to the younger me because I did not understand the meaning, but to me right now it means how much she loves and cares about me. She had her 80th birthday celebration this year with her children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren. In China, 80th birthday is a very big deal for family, and I am so regret that I cannot celebrate with her, but I am still very grateful that I have one of the best grandmothers in the world.
